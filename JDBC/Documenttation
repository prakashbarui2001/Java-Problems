    The " forName() " method of Class class is used to register the driver class. 
    This method is used to dynamically load the driver class.
    Syntax of forName() method:-
     {public static void forName(String className)throws ClassNotFoundException.}
    example :[Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")];

4.Create connection on mtysql?
  =) Connection URL: The connection URL for the mysql database is {jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/}sonoo where
     jdbc is the API, mysql is the database, localhost is the server name on which mysql is running, 
     we may also use IP address, 3306 is the port number and sonoo is the database name.
     We may use any database, in such case, we need to replace the sonoo with our database name.
     Real Example =Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(  
                    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sonoo","root","root");
