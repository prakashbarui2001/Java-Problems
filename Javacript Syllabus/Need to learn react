What to Learn Before Covering React ???
There are specific concepts you need to understand before going into React. Here are the topics you should learn to better understand React:

1.Different methods available on JavaScript: It is recommended you learn default methods
  for data types like strings and arrays such as map, filter, reduce, sort, include, split, join, reverse, etc.  
  
2.Promises, callbacks, and asynchronous JavaScript: You have to make network calls asynchronously, 
  and for that, the knowledge of asynchronous JS and how to handle AJAX requests becomes necessary.
  
3.Async Await: Async-await provides a more straightforward way to interact with promises.
  They make asynchronous code look synchronous, and yet, the work is still asynchronous.
  
4.Modules, import, export: When working with React, you isolate your components on separate files.
  You export some elements from a file and import them to another.
  
5.Inheritance: This allows you to create a class that inherits
   all the functionality of its parent class, and add extra features.
   
6.Typecasting: Typecasting, also known as coercion, 
  is the conversion of a data type to another data type.
  
7.Constructor function: This allows you to do the necessary
  custom initialization on an instantiated object.
  
8.Undefined and Null: Undefined is a variable declared
  without any value assigned, while null is an assignment value. 
  
9.Array functions: This enables you to perform multiple
  calculations on several items in an array. 
  
10.Block-level scoping: The block scope restricts the outside
   of a specific block from accessing the variable declared inside the block.

We recommend focusing on the client-side development skills and some other JS-relevant techniques such as:

Fetch API and errors in JavaScript 
Optional chaining in JavaScript 
Async/Await in JavaScript 
Unique value – set () in JavaScript 
Reduce () in JavaScript 
Dynamic object keys in JavaScript
Event delegation
Rest and spread operators in JavaScript 
Map () in JavaScript 
Destructuring arrays and objects in JavaScript 
Filter () and find () in JavaScript 
Callback functions in JavaScript 
Promises in JavaScript 











   
   
   
11.The “this” keyword and its binding rules: “This” keyword is 
   an object executing the current piece of code or function.
   
12.Arrow functions: This introduces concise body syntax to 
   let you create functions in a cleaner way than the regular functions. 
   
13.Exception handling: With this feature, you can handle
   coding errors and maintain a regular JavaScript flow. 
   
14.String manipulation: This involves the different processes 
   of handling, analyzing, and modifying strings. 
   
15.Event bubbling and capturing: Event bubbling is when you propagate an
   event from a child element to ancestor elements in the DOM while event capturing is the propagation of an event from ancestor elements to a child element.
